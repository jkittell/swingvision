# Multi-Angle Video Analysis

## Overview
Multi-angle video analysis allows golfers to record and analyze their swing from different perspectives (front, side, back) to get a complete understanding of their swing mechanics.

## Key Components

### 1. Video Capture
- Support for multiple video uploads of the same swing
- Ability to record from different angles:
  - Face-on (front view)
  - Down-the-line (side view)
  - Behind view
  - Optional: Over-the-top view

### 2. Video Synchronization
- Automatic synchronization of videos from different angles using:
  - Audio cues (club impact sound)
  - Motion detection (swing initiation)
  - Manual sync point selection
- Frame alignment across all angles

### 3. Analysis Features
- Swing plane analysis from multiple angles
- Club path tracking in 3D space
- Body position verification from all angles
- Impact position analysis
- Follow-through assessment

### 4. Visualization
- Side-by-side video playback
- Synchronized playback controls
- Frame-by-frame comparison
- Overlay of ideal positions from each angle
- 3D swing reconstruction (future feature)
